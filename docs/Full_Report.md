## 1. Environment & Setup
- venv + dbt-duckdb installed.  
- Warehouse at `dbt/warehouse/balta.duckdb`.  
- Seeds: customers, policies, claims, offers.  
- Commands: `dbt seed`, `dbt run`, `dbt test`.

## 2. Medallion Modeling (dbt)

**Silver layer**  
- `stg_customers` (birth_date, created_at, base attrs)  
- `stg_policies` (dedup by policy_version, amounts, dates)  
- `stg_claims` (typed)  
- `stg_offers` (timestamp + hash)

**Gold layer**  
- `dim_customers` (age, age_group)  
- `dim_products` (product_code + variant key)  
- `fact_claims` (grain = claim)  
- `fct_policy_premium` (grain = policy; written + earned premium)

### New dimensions from Customers
- Age group (00â€“17, â€¦, 65+)  
- Geography (city/country)  
- Segment (Retail/SME/Corporate)

### New dimensions from Policies
- Product (built)  
- Policy Status, Sales Channel, Currency, Policy Term

## 3. Business Logic

### Earned Premium
`written_premium * elapsed_days / total_days` (bounded, uses `as_of_date` var)

### Claim Ratio
Î£(Claims) / Î£(Earned Premium), aggregated by product.

### Average Premium & Claim by Age Group
Mart implemented via join to `dim_customers` age buckets.

### Counting Strategy
Stable fact grain; config table mapping product â†’ rule; dbt derived counts; PBI measures select rule. Prevents double-counting.

---

## 4. Data Quality & Profiling
- dbt schema tests: unique, not_null, relationships.  
- Dedup policies by version.  
- Custom tests: policiesâ†’customers, customer date validity.  
- Profiling found missing birth dates, implausible ages, inconsistent free-texts.  
- Claims vs coverage test considered but skipped (late reporting).  

---

## 5. Python Integration
- `validate_data.py` â†’ duplicate policies, invalid dates, orphan claims, missing births. Output: `docs/validation_report.md`.  
- `offers_uniqueness.py` â†’ flags last offer in 24h/7d/30d window per customer+coverage. Output: `exports/offers_with_uniqueness.csv`.  
- Efficiency: Pandas good for demo; production should use SQL windowing for scale.
